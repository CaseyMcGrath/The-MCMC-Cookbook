# Ingredients

As we create our MCMC recipes, we will add capabilities and functions depending on what we want and need from the following list of ingredients:


````{tab-set}

```{tab-item} Conveniences
- progress tracking bar
- efficiency tracking diagnostics
    - jump acceptance ratios
    - temperature swap acceptance ratios
- cyclic parameters
```

```{tab-item} Priors
- Uniform
- Log-Uniform
- Normal
```

```{tab-item} Jump Proposals
- symmetric jumps
    - Gaussian/Multivariate Normal
- prior jumps
- block (gibbs) jumps
- multiple jump schemes
```

```{tab-item} MCMC Techniques
