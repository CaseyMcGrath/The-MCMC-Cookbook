# The-MCMC-Cookbook

A reference "cookbook" for learning how to construct Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler algorithms from scratch, for performing Bayesian analyses.  MCMC samplers are simple algorithms, but can be coded up with enormous variation.  The types of "ingredients" that can go into making an MCMC often depend on how complicated the problem of interest is.  Relatively simple posterior distributions can potentially be sampled with a relatively simple MCMC sampler.  But as the posterior becomes more complex, a useful and efficient sampler will likely require a more complex "recipe."  The goal of this cookbook is to help you learn how to make a recipe (from scratch) that will work best for you!
